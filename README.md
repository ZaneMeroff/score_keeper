### Introduction
Welcome to Score Keeper, a mobile friendly single page web application created to keep track of scores for any kind of game. The app gives a user the ability to set score boundaries and customize player/team names with a colorful and easy to use UI/UX. 

### Why Did I Build This?
This is the most recent project Iâ€™ve created to showcase the evolution of my programming skills. The app features clean, reusable, strictly typed code and components built with methods leveraging the single responsibility principle. The app uses a global Vuex store and the Quasar component library. Jest is used in conjunction with Vue Test Utils to create a robust and thorough unit testing suite.

### Screenshots

### Jest Testing Suite
The project contains `____ unit tests` across all `____` components making unit testing coverage nearly 100%. Iâ€™ve written unit tests covering all elements of each Vue component with happy/sad paths as necessary for: data, methods, props, watch, computed, lifecycle hooks, events/user interactions, routes, and snapshot renders. To run the testing suite and view test coverage, see instructions in "How to run the Jest testing suite with NPM" below.

### Directions for Use

`Increase/Decrease Score`<br>
Use the + or - buttons found in the center of a player card surrounding the displayed score (starts at 0). 

`Change Player Name`<br>
Select the edit button (pencil icon) left of a player's name found in the top left of each player card.

`Delete Single Player`<br>
Select the delete button (trash icon) in the top right corner of each player card.

`Add Additional Players`<br>
Select the *Add Players* button from the menu drawer (opened using hamburger button in top left of app) and enter the number of additional players. The app starts with 2 players and has a max of 50 players.

`Adjust Score Limits/Boundaries`<br>
Select the *Score Limits* button from the menu drawer and enter the desired minimum and maximum scores. The app starts with 0 as the min score and 10 as the max score. The min score's range is -500 to 0 and the max score's range is 1 to 500. Note, if a player currently has a score outside of the new score limits, the app will reset all player's scores to 0.

`Reset All Scores to Zero`<br>
Select the *Zero Scores* button from the menu drawer. This will permanently reset every player's score to 0.

`Delete All Players`<br>
Select the *Delete Players* button from the menu drawer. This will permanently delete all players from the app.

### How to run app on a local machine with NPM
1. shut down any live servers you currently have running (`control` + `c`)
2. clone down this repo to desired location
3. `cd` into the newly cloned repo directory
4. run `npm install`
5. run `npm run serve`
6. you should now be able to run the app in your browser-the default url is likely `http://localhost:8080`

### How to run the Jest testing suite with NPM
